#CardboardKnight.Scoring.Games
Repository of [`CardboardKnight.Scoring`](https://github.com/TheCardboardKnight/Scoring.Spec/) formatted game scoring data.

Organised into

```
Games \
	<BGGID>
		Label.json
		Label.rul
		
```

This file structure allows for multiple implementations for each game. This allows for more or complex rulesets to be chosen from depending on what creates the best player experience.
